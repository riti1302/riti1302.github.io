        <p>Hello. Hi. If you’re here to get to know me, you’ve come to the right place. For the serious stuff, like my work as a Machine Learning Engineer, you can check out my professional background neatly packed into my <a href="Resume.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#3b82f6;font-weight:500;text-decoration:underline;">Resume</a>.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1em;"></p>
        <p>Now for the non-serious stuff. I like doing a lot of things. I travel, read, cook, sing, and, above all, I like to play. Most often, that means badminton (I’m decently good at it). I also play volleyball (not as good anymore, but I enjoy it nonetheless). And I’m learning squash, at my own pace.</p>
        <p>Sometimes I write. I don’t think I’m very good at it, but I try.</p>
        <p>After working as an ML Engineer for 4 years, I'm now doing my masters from Georgia Tech. It is fun. Will recommend 10/10.</p>
