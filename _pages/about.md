Hello. Hi. If you’re here to get to know me, you’ve come to the right place. For the serious stuff, like my work as a Machine Learning Engineer, you can check out my professional background neatly packed into my [Resume](Resume.pdf).

Now for the non-serious stuff. I like doing a lot of things. I travel, read, cook, sing, and, above all, I like to play. Most often, that means badminton (I’m decently good at it). I also play volleyball (not as good anymore, but I enjoy it nonetheless). And I’m learning squash, at my own pace.

Sometimes I write. I don’t think I’m very good at it, but I try.

After working as an ML Engineer for 4 years, I'm now doing my masters from Georgia Tech. It is fun. Will recommend 10/10.
