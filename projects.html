        <h3 style="color: #1696ec;">Flexible LLM Inference with Multi Model Prefill and Decode</h3>
        <p>Implemented a stitched LLM architecture using separate models for prefill and decode phases, improving both TTFT and TBT while maintaining model accuracy. Achieved 5% decrease in latency than the baseline model (using same bigger model in both the phases). Tested out generalization capability for the architecture on different tasks (q/a, summarization, code completion, math problems)</p>

        <h3 style="color: #1696ec;">Physics-Informed Neural Network for Aerodynamic Analysis</h3>
        <p>Built a PyTorch-based point-wise neural network with physics-informed loss constraints that maps spatial coordinates and design parameters to aerodynamic flow fields. Transformed a data-limited problem (500 configurations) into 35M training samples through pointwise prediction, achieving fast surrogate modeling for CFD simulations with R² > 0.95.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #1696ec;">Keyword Based Extraction of Library Resources</h3>
        <p>Developed an end-to-end pipeline to find relevant books/journals from the database given 4-5 keywords. Winner solution at Smart India Hackathon 2019 and the solution is set up in PD Hinduja Hospital and Research Center.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #1696ec;">Correction of Annotation Affected Words in Document Images</h3>
        <p>Worked on removal of annotations from scanned document images using advanced computer vision techniques. Built a spelling correction model for correction of sentences extracted from the OCR with a bleu score 10.64</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: #1696ec;">Hydra: A Zombie Survivor Game</h3>
        <p>Developed a multiplayer game using Unity and C# where players must survive against waves of zombies. Implemented features like player customization, weapon upgrades, and a dynamic environment that changes based on player actions.
