title: 'Norwegian Wood'

What a waste of a week. The book is half smut and half pure sadness. There's death and morally questionable things happening all the time. Not once, while reading it, have I felt warm. The dating culture in Japan is portrayed much worse than the dating culture in the US. The writing is good, but the content is just trashy and extremely sad.
