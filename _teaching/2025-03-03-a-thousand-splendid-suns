title: "A Thousand Splendid Suns"

A Thousand Splendid Suns is undoubtedly one of the most heartbreaking books I’ve ever read. Khaled Hosseini has done such a remarkable story telling as it cups you in sorrow but still leaves you yearning to read more. After a few chapters, the sorrow becomes additive. Unlike kite runner, Hosseini has kept it so well grounded in reality, with no over-the-top drama, just the raw, unforgiving nature of life. The last few chapters had me sobbing uncontrollably.
