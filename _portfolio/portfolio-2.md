First northern lights experience and a visit to Santa Claus Village
For the clearest view of the northern lights, we traveled 1.5 hours from the city to a snow-covered forest in -20 °C — the temperature at which your words start slurring. The cold itself was a unique experience.
Saw Santa's home in all its glory and mailed a letter to India from the world's northernmost post office.
Not mentioning the best beer I had would be a crime. Kahru beer FTW.
