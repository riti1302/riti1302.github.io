The Avicii museum that I couldn't visit and the world's best meatballs.
Avicii Museum was the one place I was most excited to visit, not because I was a fan but this friend of mine told me so much about it that I became a fan. But sadly they closed early the day I decided to go there. But they let us explore the ground floor area and I was happy enough that I was able to see something.
And of course tried the best meatballs with the tastiest sauce.
