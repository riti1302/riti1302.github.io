I’m 25 now. Looking back, my sense of sports didn’t develop particularly early in my life. There were, of course, childhood games such as hide-and-seek, seven stones, blindfold, and many more. But these won’t be counted as real sports. At least they weren’t for me. Then, after a few years, we started playing gully cricket, badminton, and some basic version of football, all perhaps until 4th-5th standard.
