title: "Physics-Informed Neural Network for Aerodynamic Analysis"
excerpt: 'Built a PyTorch-based point-wise neural network with physics-informed loss constraints that maps spatial coordinates and design parameters to aerodynamic flow fields. Transformed a data-limited problem (500 configurations) into 35M training samples through pointwise prediction, achieving fast surrogate modeling for CFD simulations with R² > 0.95.'
